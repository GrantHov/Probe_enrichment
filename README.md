Script for counting human and fungal reads


This script counts the number of reads/alignments which are mapped to human and C. albicans, when sequencing combined 
samples (i.e. clinical samples of candidiasis).
As an input, the script expects a file listing the bam files (i.e. "file_list.txt"), for example:

```
sample_1.bam
sample_2.bam
sample_n.bam
```
